# Virtual-Mouse
<<<<<<<----------Desktop Navigation With Hand Gesture---------->>>>>>>
We all wonder it would have been so comfortable if we could control cursor through the use of hand gestures.
Our proposed project puts forward a hand gesture based system that allows user to control the pc mouse movements through the use of hand movements.
Our system uses pc webcam in order to detect hand gesture movements.
The system continuously scans the camera input for five fingers hand like patterns.
Once a hand is detected, the system then locks it as an object.
A flag is set on the object in order to mark it as an object.
After the object has been flagged and detected, our system then constantly records its movements in terms of X Y direction movement based coordinates.
These coordinate are then mapped real time onto the mouse cursor to move it according to hand movements.
